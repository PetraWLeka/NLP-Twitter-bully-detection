This project focuses on detecting bullying behavior on Twitter by leveraging machine learning **NLP** techniques. It utilizes **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks and **Multinomial Naive Bayes (NB)** classifiers to analyze and classify tweets for potential bullying content. The LSTM model captures the sequential nature of text data, while the Multinomial NB classifier provides a probabilistic approach to text classification.
