This project focuses on detecting bullying behavior on Twitter by leveraging machine learning ** NLP ** techniques. It utilizes ** Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) ** networks and ** Multinomial Naive Bayes (NB) ** classifiers to analyze and classify tweets for potential bullying content. The LSTM model captures the sequential nature of text data, while the Multinomial NB classifier provides a probabilistic approach to text classification.
